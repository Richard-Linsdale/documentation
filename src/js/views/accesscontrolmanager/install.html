        <p>This is available as a shell script installer. It can be downloaded
            from <a href="http://www.rlinsdale.org.uk/repository/uk/org/rlinsdale/accesscontrolmanager/1.0.9/accesscontrolmanager-1.0.9-linux.sh">here</a>.</p>

        <p>The software requires Java 8 to run, so please ensure that the
            Java 8 JRE has been installed, and that it is the default Java
            environment on your machine. If you need more assistance on
            installing Java 8 on your machine please look
            at <a href="http://www.rlinsdale.org.uk/software/commondocumentation/install-java8.html">this documentation</a>.</p>

        <p>To install the program, execute the script which you have downloaded.  The script
            must initially be marked as a executable.</p>

        <pre><code>chmod 744 accesscontrolmanager-1.0.9-linux.sh
./accesscontrolmanager-1.0.9-linux.sh
</code></pre>

        <p>To execute the solution once installed, the program can be launched via a desktop icon or the Application
            Menu entry (assumed these options where not disabled during the installation).</p>
