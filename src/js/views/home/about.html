    <p>
        As a software engineer with over 40 years experience of software development,
        product delivery and project management, I have wide range of experience
        in the profession.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now retired I have returned to my roots as a programmer, currently
        developing Open Source projects targeted at not-for-profit organisations or
        personal use.  
    </p>
    <p>
        My preferred language is Java, developed using the Netbeans IDE, but am
        flexible and experienced
        enough to be able to deliver in a wider range of languages and platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am also interested in embedded solutions and currently involved in both
        Raspberry Pi and Arduino based projects.
