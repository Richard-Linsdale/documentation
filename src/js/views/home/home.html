    <p>
        I am currently developing Open Source projects targeted at not-for-profit organisations or
        personal use.  
    </p>
    <p>
        My preferred language is Java, using Netbeans IDE, but flexible and experienced
        enough to be able to take on a wider range of languages and platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am also interested in embedded solutions and currently involved in both Raspberry Pi and Arduino based projects. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To view the range of projects that are available and their associated documentation
        please navigate to the applications section, where you will find the list of all
        available applications, libraries and firmware, and can follow a link to the project's
        documentation.
