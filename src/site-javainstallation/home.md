Many of **The Retired Programmer** applications are built using the Java 
language.  So to be able to run these, you will need the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
installed on your machine.

Due to the backward compatibility delivered by the Java platform, the general
guidelines is to install the latest version of the JRE as your default Java
installation.  So these instructions only cover the latest Java version.

Installation instruction exist for Java 8:
